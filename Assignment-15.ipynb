    "Ans: A database is a collection of data that is organized in a specific way to enable efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data. Databases are used to store data for a wide range of applications, including e-commerce, healthcare, finance, and social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two types of database management systems, each with its own advantages and use cases. SQL databases are based on the relational database model, where data is stored in tables consisting of rows and columns, with relationships between tables defined using primary keys and foreign keys. SQL databases are known for their strong consistency, data integrity, and the ability to handle complex queries. Popular SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are not based on the relational model and are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, such as documents, graphs, or key-value pairs. NoSQL databases are known for their high scalability, availability, and the ability to handle large amounts of data. However, they may sacrifice some degree of consistency and data integrity in favor of performance and scalability. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are suited for applications that require strong consistency and complex queries, while NoSQL databases are better suited for applications that require high scalability and performance with less emphasis on data consistency."

    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TABLE customers;\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers ADD phone VARCHAR(20);\n",
    "```\n",
