    "Ans: An exception in Python is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions are used to handle errors and exceptional conditions in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntactically incorrect statements, such as a misspelled keyword or a missing bracket, are called syntax errors. These errors occur when the code is written incorrectly and can be detected by the Python interpreter before the code is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, exceptions are runtime errors that occur when the code is executed and can be caused by a variety of reasons, such as division by zero, accessing an index outside the bounds of a list, or trying to open a file that does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are detected before the code is executed and exceptions are raised during the execution of the code."
