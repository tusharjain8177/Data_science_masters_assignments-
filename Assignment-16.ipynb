    "Ans: MongoDB is a popular, open-source document-oriented NoSQL database. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which can have varying structures, making it well-suited for handling unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media content, log data, and sensor data. MongoDB supports features like dynamic schema, automatic sharding, high availability, and horizontal scalability, which make it an attractive choice for large-scale, high-performance applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) model. Unlike SQL databases, NoSQL databases do not rely on a fixed schema, and they can store data in various formats like key-value, document, column-family, and graph. NoSQL databases are generally designed to handle high volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, and they often provide better scalability and performance than SQL databases for these types of workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several scenarios where MongoDB may be preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data: MongoDB's document-based model is particularly well-suited for handling data that doesn't fit well into a fixed schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rapid application development: MongoDB's dynamic schema allows developers to add and modify fields on the fly, making it easier to adapt to changing application requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "High availability and scalability: MongoDB's automatic sharding and replica sets provide built-in high availability and scalability features that make it easier to handle large-scale applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud-native applications: MongoDB's support for cloud-native development and deployment makes it an ideal choice for building modern, cloud-based applications.\n",

    "Ans: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that offers several unique features that set it apart from traditional relational databases. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document Model: MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents that can have nested structures, making it a natural fit for handling complex data structures. Each document can have its own unique schema, allowing for greater flexibility and faster development cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dynamic Schema: MongoDB's dynamic schema allows for changes to the data structure without the need for predefined schema or migrations. This allows for greater agility and faster development cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple nodes, allowing for linear scalability and the ability to handle large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. High Availability: MongoDB is designed to be highly available with built-in features such as replica sets and automatic failover, ensuring that your application can continue to function even in the event of hardware or software failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Indexing: MongoDB has a powerful indexing system that allows for efficient querying of large data sets. It supports a wide range of indexing options, including single-field indexes, compound indexes, text indexes, and geospatial indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Aggregation Framework: MongoDB's aggregation framework provides a powerful set of tools for analyzing and processing data within the database. It allows for complex queries, data transformations, and data aggregation to be performed directly within the database, reducing the need for application-level processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Native Drivers: MongoDB provides native drivers for many programming languages, making it easy to integrate with your existing application stack. These drivers provide a high-level API for interacting with the database, simplifying development and reducing the need for low-level database operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB's unique features make it a popular choice for developers looking for a flexible, scalable, and high-performance database solution."

    "Ans: In MongoDB, `delete_one()`, `delete_many()`, and `drop()` are used to remove data from a collection in the database. Here is a brief explanation of each method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `delete_one(filter, collation=None)`: This method deletes a single document from a collection that matches the specified filter. The `filter` parameter is used to specify the criteria for matching documents, and the `collation` parameter is optional and used for specifying language-specific rules for string comparisons. This method is useful when you want to delete a specific document from a collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `delete_many(filter, collation=None)`: This method deletes multiple documents from a collection that match the specified filter. The `filter` parameter is used to specify the criteria for matching documents, and the `collation` parameter is optional and used for specifying language-specific rules for string comparisons. This method is useful when you want to delete multiple documents from a collection that meet a specific criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `drop()`: This method is used to delete an entire collection from the database. This is a permanent action, and once a collection is dropped, it cannot be recovered. This method is useful when you want to completely remove a collection from your database.\n",
    "\n",
