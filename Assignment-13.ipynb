    "Ans: Multithreading in Python is the ability to execute multiple threads simultaneously. It allows programs to run faster and make better use of available system resources. The threading module is used to handle threads in Python. It provides an easy way to create and manage threads in Python programs. The module provides basic synchronization primitives such as locks, events, and semaphores. It also provides access to advanced features such as thread-local data and the ability to control thread execution.\n",

By using multiple threads to execute tasks simultaneously, programs can make better use of available system resources and run faster. Additionally, it allows for more flexible control over the program's execution and can provide more efficient ways to process data.\n",
