    "There are two main types of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.\n",

    "Descriptive statistics: These statistics are used to describe and summarize the main features of a dataset. The most common descriptive statistics include measures of central tendency (e.g. mean, median, mode) and measures of variability (e.g. range, standard deviation, variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A company wants to summarize the salaries of its employees. They might use descriptive statistics to calculate the average salary, the highest and lowest salaries, and the standard deviation of salaries to describe the distribution of salaries within the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics: These statistics are used to make inferences about a population based on a sample. Inferential statistics use probability theory to estimate population parameters (e.g. mean, proportion) from sample statistics (e.g. sample mean, sample proportion).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A political pollster wants to know what percentage of voters support a certain candidate. Instead of asking every voter, the pollster will take a random sample of voters and use inferential statistics to estimate the percentage of voters who support the candidate with a certain level of confidence."

Examples of descriptive statistics include measures of central tendency (such as the mean, median, and mode), measures of dispersion (such as the range, standard deviation, and variance), and graphical representations of the data (such as histograms and box plots).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a researcher may use descriptive statistics to describe the demographic characteristics of a sample of study participants, including their age, gender, and education level. The researcher may calculate the mean age of the participants, the percentage of males and females in the sample, and the distribution of education levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics, on the other hand, are used to make inferences about a population based on a sample of data. They allow researchers to draw conclusions about a population based on limited data. Inferential statistics involve hypothesis testing, estimation, and prediction. Examples of inferential statistics include t-tests, ANOVA, regression analysis, and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a researcher may use inferential statistics to test whether a new drug is more effective than an existing drug in treating a certain disease. The researcher may randomly assign participants to either the new drug or the existing drug group, and then compare the outcomes between the two groups using a t-test or ANOVA. The results of the test would allow the researcher to infer whether the new drug is more effective than the existing drug in treating the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe data, while inferential statistics are used to make inferences and draw conclusions about a larger population based on a sample of data. Both types of statistics are important in data analysis, and are often used in combination to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data."
