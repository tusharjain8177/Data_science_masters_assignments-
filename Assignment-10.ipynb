    "Ans: The close() function is used to close an open file in Python. It is important to close a file because it frees up resources (such as memory) that the file was consuming while it was open, and also ensures that any changes made to the file are saved and properly written to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a file in Python, the operating system reserves a portion of memory for it, and the file remains open and accessible to your program until you explicitly close it. If you open many files or large files and never close them, you could run out of memory and cause your program to crash or hang.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, if you make changes to an open file and do not close it, those changes might not be saved, or could be saved only partially. Closing the file ensures that any buffered data is flushed to disk and all changes are persisted to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is a best practice to close a file as soon as you are done using it, to ensure that your program runs efficiently and that your data is properly saved. In Python, you can use the with statement to automatically close a file when you're done with it, so you don't need to remember to close it manually."
